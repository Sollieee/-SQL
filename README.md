Hello and welcome to this repository! In this read me file, I'll be providing an overview of the SQL queries that I have written.

Query to select data from a single table: This query selects data from a single table and returns all the columns. It can be used to extract specific data from a table based on certain criteria.

Query to join two tables: This query uses a JOIN statement to combine data from two tables based on a common column. It is useful when working with multiple tables that contain related data.

Query to filter data: This query uses a WHERE clause to filter data based on specific criteria. It is useful when you only want to see data that meets certain conditions.

Query to sort data: This query uses the ORDER BY clause to sort data based on one or more columns. It is useful when you want to view data in a specific order, such as alphabetically or numerically.

Query to group data: This query uses the GROUP BY clause to group data based on one or more columns. It is useful when you want to summarize data or perform calculations on groups of data.

Query to aggregate data: This query uses aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX to perform calculations on data. It is useful when you want to perform calculations on data within a specific column or group of columns.

Query to insert data: This query uses the INSERT INTO statement to add new data to a table. It is useful when you need to add new data to a table that doesn't already exist.


In conclusion, these SQL queries are some of the fundamental tools used in database management and data analysis. They are versatile and can be used to perform a wide range of tasks, from filtering data to calculating summaries. With these queries in your arsenal, you'll be well-equipped to handle most data-related tasks.
